Control software for large RGB LED matrix, currently imageconverter directory
contains the interesting stuff.

beagle_spi_documentation.md is probably worth a look as well.

max33xxE_somethign -files contain library and a breakout board for this voltage translator, needed to make the beagleboard talk with 5V logic.
