# xmega based framebuffer for the matrix

Some day this will be a SPI/I2C/UART controllable framebuffer that will
take raw RGB data and munge it to correct order for the matrix and then 
use DMA to ship the data out.

That day is likely very far away now that I decided to use a BeagleBoard to
do the heavy lifting.
